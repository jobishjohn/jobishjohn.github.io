  I am affiliated with the <a href="http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/"> Stanford DAWN</a> project. I am broadly interested in efficient and effective data analytics for large-scale, machine generated data. Recently I have been interested in approximate nearest neighbour methods, with applications in accelerating kernel summations and large-scale earthquake detection. </p>
 <p>I graduated from Caltech in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Before that, I attended Nanjing Foreign Language School in Nanjing, China.</p>
